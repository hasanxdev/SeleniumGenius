# SeleniumGenius üöÄ

SeleniumGenius is an expert tool for working with Selenium, providing access to the core Selenium settings along with the following features:

## What Problems Can I Solve? üõ†Ô∏è

- üíæ Memory leakage issue after force-closing the application on its first run. 
- üì• Automatic download of compatible driver versions for the browser.
- üîê Ensuring that your browser is always logged in.
- üèÅ Resolving concurrency issues with multiple threads sending commands to Chrome.
- ‚ú® Support from CancellationToken
- üîÄ Running multiple instances of the driver to utilize more processing power simultaneously without interference between different instances.
- üßπ Optional disposal of the driver after completing tasks and clearing the browser cache after disposal.
- üêã Settings for Docker support.
- üåê Having a dedicated HttpClient for sending requests to the site using browser cookies.

# Using SeleniumGenius üìù
All of these features are abstracted behind a single method called `CreateAsync`. After adding the service, simply inject the `SeleniumGeniusFactory` class and use its `CreateAsync` method:

```csharp
_ = await seleniumGeniusFactory.CreateAsync(cancellationToken);
```

## Installation and Setup: [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SeleniumGenius)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SeleniumGenius/)

#### Via PMC (Package manager console): 

```
PM> Install-Package SeleniumGenius
```
#### Via dotnet CLI
```
dotnet add package SeleniumGenius
```

Then add the following settings to your services:

```csharp
builder.AddSeleniumGenius(options =>
{
    options.WithLoginData(new List<LoginData>()
    {
        new()
        {
            Username = "admin",
            Password = "Admin@123",
            Email = "admin@admin.com"
        }
    });

    options.WithLogin(loginRequest =>
    {
        return new LoginResult(true, "successfully logged in");
    });
}, service =>
{
    service.EnableVerboseLogging = false;
    service.SuppressInitialDiagnosticInformation = true;
    service.HideCommandPromptWindow = true;
});
```

- Here, options represents ChromeOptions, and service represents ChromeDriverService.
Various sample settings are provided below, and we'll delve into each setting in detail.
- üì¢ Also you can use `builder.AddSeleniumGeniusWithPreTermination()` this method just work on windows linux and mac not supported, this method within itself use static class `GeniusDriverTermination.Terminate()` this class force close chrome drivers and chrome browsers.
    - üí°Tips: Have a HostedService with name `StopGeniusDriversHostedService` that when application normally stopped try to kill all chrome drivers and chrome browsers 

# Options Settings ‚öôÔ∏è:  
01. `options.WithDimensions()`: Set the dimensions and position of your Chrome window. Note that it does not work in headless mode.  
02. `options.WithRelativeCachePath()`: Customize the cache path for Chrome files to reduce login frequency and retain cookies.
